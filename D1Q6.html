    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>

    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter It is a fascinatmg field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    
    <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are
        classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>  
    
    <p>Chemical reactions are reptesented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
    
    <p> 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O  </p>
    
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
    
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    
    <p> <b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> Indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup>
        represent charges or the number of atoms m an ion.</p>
    
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our
        lives.</p>
